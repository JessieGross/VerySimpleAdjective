# Intro to Very Simple Adjective App

Welcomes to a "Very Simple Adjective" where the app will find the adjective of two words starting with 'very', for example 'very bright', 'very cool'. 

This simple yet creative app was inspired by Connor Callahan's "Lose the very" (https://www.losethevery.com/).
